# Frogger Game

## Description
The player controls a frog, which must cross a series of lanes and obstacles to reach the safety on the other end. The frog must evade the oncoming traffic and avoid the water by climbing on to tree logs to reach itsâ€™ destination. The cars and logs all move with different and randomised speeds, making it a bit more difficult for the player to time and pass them. Along the way there are coins that can be gathered which increase the total score at the end of the game. If the frog gets struck by a car or falls into the water, it is reset to the starting position and all coins are taken away, with the player having to collect them in different locations this time, as they are randomised and show up in different positions.
