# Frogger Game

## Description
The player controls a frog, which must cross a series of lanes and obstacles to reach the safety on the other end. The frog must evade the oncoming traffic and avoid the water by climbing on to tree logs to reach itsâ€™ destination. The cars and logs all move with different and randomised speeds, making it a bit more difficult for the player to time and pass them. Along the way there are coins that can be gathered which increase the total score at the end of the game. If the frog gets struck by a car or falls into the water, it is reset to the starting position and all coins are taken away, with the player having to collect them in different locations this time, as they are randomised and show up in different positions.

## Game Logic
I.	The frog can move left, right, up and down 1 grid space at a time.
II.	The speed of the objects is randomised, so every new game will be a different challenge.
III. The coin count resets if the frog is struck or falls in the water.
IV.	Coins randomly reset positions when the frog collides with a hazard.
V. The frog cannot leave the screen, if it is carried by a log, it will be pushed into the water when the log leaves the screen.
VI.	When the game starts, the player is presented with playing the game, seeing the guide on how to play or quitting.
VII. Audio in the background.
